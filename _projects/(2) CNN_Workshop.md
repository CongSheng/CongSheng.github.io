description: Introductory workshop on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

The workshop on CNN was my first workshop as a member of MLDA@EEE 
(machine learning and data analytics lab at NTU EEE). Hosting the workshop 
together with Riyan Andrika, we covered the basics of CNN such as the 
convolutional layers, the calculation for the shape of CNN, and the applications.
The pratical session involved a short guided tutorial on how to implement a 
CNN. The workshop was the first in MLDA@EEE to include some common interview
questions for CNN to expose participants to potential interview questions 
during job applications. Furthermore, I proposed a new feedback framework to 
gather feedback from participants more effectively, and is still being used in MLDA@EEE today.
