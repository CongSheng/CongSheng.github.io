Using web-scraping, I proposed the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and data to better evaluate the readiness
and risk of both Singapore and beyond. A better evaluation would enhance policy-making, decision-making, and 
anticipate outbreaks. Natural language processing, more specifically sentiment analysis, can help to process data obtained
through scraping, while the  use of reinforcement learning can potentially allow for data-fusion. This idea was chosen as the top
10 proposal nationwide in the ideation challenge organised by AI-Singapore. The simple news-scraping .ipynb file can be found
in my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CongSheng/COVID-19-NewsScraping_Sentiment).
