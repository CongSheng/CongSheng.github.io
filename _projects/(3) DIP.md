# Design & Innovation Project (DIP)

DIP is a module compulsory for all students in the school of electrical and electronic engineering (EEE),
Nanyang Technological University. Together with 5 other fellow students, my team worked together in
the project to design a water antenna. Unlike fixed-length antennas which have fixed operational
region, liquid-based antenna offers reconfigurability and flexibility due to the intrinsic properties of liquid.
This project involved first the modelling and simulation of a water antenna using Ansys HFSS(High frequency structure simulator)
before fabrication. In order to improve aesthetics of the water antenna, housings based on chess pieces were designed using Fusion360 and 3D-printed. 
Tests on the fabricated water antenna involving VNA (Vector Network Analyzer), spectrum analyzer (SA) and signal generator 
showed succes in both transmission and receving signals, with multiple water antenna offering some beam-steering abilities.
The project won the DIP competition where different groups compete within the same thematic programme (Photonics, Radar & Satellite Systems) in 2021.
