Took part in the first product design challenge hosted by Shopee in 2021, which was also the largest product and design
competition in Singapore. While my team did not have any background in UI/UX or product design, we thought it was
an interesting competition to learn from, and was suprised to emerged as one of the 30 semi-finalists among 200+ participants. 

Through the competition, I got to better appreciate the problem definition and ideation stage which occurs before the actual design.
Using Figma, we designed a simple mock-up and even coded a prototype using Android studio.
