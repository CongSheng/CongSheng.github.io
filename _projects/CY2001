MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems, a very mouthful word) are used as
multiple hardware such as sensors, display chips, and switches. As the demand for
Internet-of-things (IoT) increases, and MEMS which are used in embedded devices
are increasingly important. However, wireless communication is an energy-expensive
process in the overall energy budget, which needs to be low to ensure the small
form factor of MEMs. Phase-locked loops (PLL), with their elegance in their simple
design for complex behavior, can be used to provide an effective and efficient
modulating system for MEMs, such as through frequency-shift keying (FSK).

This research project explored the use of the PLL-FSK demodulation circuit system
using MATLAB Simulink, and consolidated some of the basic design principles for
such demodulator circuits in MEMs.
