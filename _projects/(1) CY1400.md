description: Audio feature exploration for enhanced audio-based respiratory anomaly detection.
---
We breathe as we live, and the breathing sound can offer much information 
on our health, more specifically on our respiratory condition. Even before 
COVID-19, research has been done to use breathing sounds to detect illnesses 
and anomalies in the human respiratory system, which can be very useful for 
the elderly, infants, and anyone with a compromised ability to convey 
discomfort. However, traditional anomaly detection systems require sampling
and running detection algorithms on the audio samples, which can potentially lead
to inaccuracy and inefficiency. Instead, through segmentation into breathing 
cycles, the breathing audio can be fed into the anomaly detection algorithm 
in an event-driven approach with a greater focus on the audio. 

This study was done under the supervision of Professor Arindam Basu and it 
involved exploring audio feature extraction techniques which can be used to 
better detect breathing cycles. While energy and frequency-based features
such as Mel-cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and chromagram can be used for audio
processing, this study found that spectral features such as root-mean-square and 
centroid can be sufficient for a simple, fast, and effective feature to detect 
the breathing cycles (inhalation and exhalation). 
This project was awarded the CY1400 research award,
an award which is given to CN Yang Scholars who did excellent work in their 
CY1400 research module.
