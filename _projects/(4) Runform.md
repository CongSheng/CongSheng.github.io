description: Created a Figma mock-up on an application to help runners improve running form.
---
As part of an entrepreneurship module, I proposed and created a mockup of 
an application that can analyze the running gaits of runners and provide 
solutions to improve their running forms. As a runner myself, I suffered from 
stress fractures previously due to improper training progression and degrading 
running form due to poor conditioning. Hence, I thought that computer vision
can be used to help analyze running forms easily through a smartphone camera 
and having follow-up in the form of tips or even linking up with a physiologist
or physiotherapist would be helpful to reduce running injuries.
Together with my group of 4, we researched
and even interviewed both runners and experts in computer vision, exercise physiology and 
physiotherapy to better understand the feasibility of the proposed solution.
