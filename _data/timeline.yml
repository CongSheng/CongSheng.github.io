- title: Student, Nanyang Technologcial University (NTU), School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)
  from: 2018
  to: 2022
  description: Pursued my undergraduate study with the Nanyang Scholarship, 
                the foremost undergraduate scholarship at NTU. 
                Being in the CN Yang Scholars Program, I was able to pursue a 
                multi-disciplinary and research-focused curriculum on top of my
                major in EEE. Beyond the academics, I was a active in
                Garage@EEE, MLDA@EEE, EEE Outreach Committee, 
                and my hall of residence-Pioneer Hall. Through these student-run
                clubs, and committees, my time in NTU had been enriching.
                Graduated with honours (highest distinction), 
                gained exposure, and made new friends.

- title: Research Engineer, Institute of Microelectronics

  to: present
  description: Continued my research on spiking neural network under my co-supervisor 
              (Dr. Gao Yuan) from my final-year project back in NTU, which led to a 
              submitted paper currently under review. Currently, I am exploring
              deeper into hardware modelling and implementation of artificial
              intelligence algorithms such as convolutional neural network,
              and spiking neural network.
