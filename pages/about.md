# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am currently a research engineer at the Institute of Microelectronics (IME), a research institute under Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). 
As a fortunate recipient of the National Science Scholarship (PhD), I look forward to pursue my PhD starting from Fall 2023 in the research area of energy-efficient computing. I believe that through software-hardware co-design and drawing inspiration from the biological brain, we can work towards a much more sustainable, adaptable, and intelligent computing paradigm than what we have right now.

Beyond research, I have multiple interests. I enjoy experimenting with brewing coffee (i.e. French press and Aeropress), working out, reading, and volunteering at Causes for Animals (CAS), a local animal shelter. Do feel free to reach out if you would like to have a discussion on similar interest(S) and you can [download my CV here](LeowCongSheng_CV.pdf).
