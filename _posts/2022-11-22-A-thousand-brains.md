description: My reflection after reading "A Thousand Brains - A new Theory of Intelligence" by Jeff Hawkins
---

A very interesting read which provided a fresh perspective on how the brain works.
It is so miraclous to learn that each cortical column serves is able to process
so much and create a model of the world on its own. Jeff Hawkins proposed that 
Mountcastle's universal algorithm and Francis Crick's framework revolves around
reference frame where the brain can learn structures, manipulate objects (mental
and physical) and create movements (relative movements). The key to learning 
is through movements, and each cortical column has a set of cells equivalent to
grid cells and another equivalent to place cell, and another equivalent to head 
direction cells to construct a "map" and navigate through information. Each column
learns a predictive model and all of them within the brain will come to a common
consenus through voting process. This is highly interesting as I hope to incorporate
this into hardware in the future.

Part 2 and 3 of the book covers machine intelligence and human intelligence,
where Jeff Hawkins covered about consciousness of machines, future of 
machine intelligence (ML), risks of machine intelligence, risks of human intelligence
and estate planning. However, I cannot help but feel that these two parts are
more strong in terms of language. Jeff Hawkins himself stated that these two parts
are by-no-means what it is, and are just providing points for discussion.
